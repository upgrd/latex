* Based on information form http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX
* See also: http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/faq/bibstyles.html
* Nonstandard entries: url=, annote=, crossref=,
* No url= field in standard types, should be put to note={URL \url{...}}.
* There are no comments in BibTeX .bib files, not even %
* ?NAME= describes an optional field.
* BibTeX silently ignores ignores a field whose name it doesn't know.

* crossref = {parentNAME} } ; parent must be last!
